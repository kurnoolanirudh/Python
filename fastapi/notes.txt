Python virtual environment - pyenv

To start the API type = uvicorn <filename>:app

To start the API with hot reloading type = uvicorn <filename>:app --reload

When the API gets a request fastapi tries to match the HTTP method and the path. The first match gets executed and thats it. So the order in which the path operation functions are defined matters

Schema for requests ( a contract between the client and server regarding the structure of a request )
client following a schema is useful to validate data.
all the schema stuff is done using pydantic

CRUD              HTTP Method
C - Create           POST
R - Read             GET
U - Update        PUT / PATCH
D - Delete          DELETE

PUT   = its necessary send to all the unchanged info with the changed info to server
PATCH = only changed info needs to be sent to the server
